# My Advent of Code Solutions
### https://adventofcode.com/
Advent of Code is an annual programming event that takes place in December. Each day of December leading up to Christmas, a new coding challenge is released, and participants solve these puzzles in a programming language of their choice. This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges for each day of each year in which I have participated.
